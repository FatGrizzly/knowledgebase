In this article, you will learn how to set your name servers to InfinitzHost! For this tutorial, we will be using GoDaddy. You might have another provider but the steps are the same. Refer to your domain support for help if necessary.

What Is a Name Server? Name servers help connect URLs with the IP address of web servers. Name servers are an important part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which many people call the “phone book of the Internet”.

How to change it?

Step – 1:  Go to Domain Management.

Step – 2:   Scroll Down to Name servers.

Step – 3:   Enter the name servers for free hosting, set the Name Servers as dns3.infinitzhost.com and dns4.infinitzhost.com. For Premium hosting, set the name servers as dns1.infinitzhost.com and dns2.infinitzhost.com.

Step – 4:   Wait for propagation. DNS propagation can take up to 24hrs but It usually takes 20-30 minutes but yours may propagate faster.
